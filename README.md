18S Amplicon targeted sequencing (2x250 PE Illumina) for multiple _Plasmodium_ species.   

The amplicon target ranges from 207 - 220 base-pairs for _Pf_, _Po_, and _Pm_ but is 270 base-pairs for _Pv_. Here we are using SeekDeep version 3.0.1-dev to account for these differences in overlap statuses.
